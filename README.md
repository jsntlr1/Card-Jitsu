## Tutorial
This is a simple rock, paper, scissors game where fire beats ice, ice beats water, and water beats fire. If the elements are the same, the higher number wins, otherwise, it's a draw.
To keep it simple, every 3 won rounds is a win. The player has 30 seconds to pick a card, otherwise it is autoplayed. The player starts at no belt, and can progress up to black.
